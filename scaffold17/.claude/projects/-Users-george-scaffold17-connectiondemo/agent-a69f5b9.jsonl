To add your custom network, go to `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` and add your network to the networks object.\n\nExample configuration:\n```typescript\nnetworks: {\n  // ... other networks\n  base: {\n    url: \"https://mainnet.base.org\",\n    accounts: [deployerPrivateKey]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### Deploying to Multiple Chains\n\nBy default `yarn deploy` will deploy all the contracts from your `packages/hardhat/contracts` folder to the local network. You can change `defaultNetwork` in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` file. To deploy to a specific network, you can also use the `--network` flag.\n\n### Frontend Configuration for Multi-Chain\n\nTo ensure autocompletions function correctly, always update the `targetNetworks` in `scaffold.config.ts` to include the relevant network/chain whenever you deploy your contract using `yarn deploy --network`. The `deployedContracts.ts` file is auto-generated/updated whenever you run `yarn deploy --network`. It organizes contract addresses and ABIs based on chainId.(no content)To target the Moonbeam-based network that you deployed your smart contract to, you'll need to edit the configurations in the `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` file. More specifically, you'll need to modify the `targetNetworks` array in the `scaffoldConfig` object. You can use the list of chains that viem provides to specify the chain(s) you've deployed your contract to.\n\n### Important Note for Multi-Chain Setups\n\nWhen having multiple chains configured in `targetNetworks`, make sure to have same `contractName`'s on other chains as `targetNetworks[0].id`. This ensures proper functionality and autocompletion of custom hooks, as the current setup and types assumes that same contract's are present on other chains as `targetNetworks[0]`.\n\n### API Keys\n\nBy default, Scaffold-ETH 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Alchemy and Etherscan. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services. For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues).\n\n### Foundry Support\n\nBy default, `yarn deploy` runs `Deploy.s.sol`, deploying to the local network using Anvil's 9th account. Change the `default_network` in `packages/foundry/foundry.toml` to change default deployment network. To deploy to a specific network, you can also use the `--network` flag.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"1a2b6226-5ac8-4b8e-9d88-b709c4f9c20a","timestamp":"2026-01-07T18:47:20.512Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"scaffold-eth multiple chains contract deployments configuration","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01DY4rA36G8bVrgLW4iVXMBx","content":[{"title":"Introduction to Scaffold-ETH 🏗 | Quicknode Guides","url":"https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/smart-contracts/introduction-to-scaffold-eth"},{"title":"Deploy Smart Contracts – 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 | Docs","url":"https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts"},{"title":"Deploy Your Smart Contracts | 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 | Docs","url":"https://scaffold-eth-2-docs.vercel.app/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts"},{"title":"GitHub - scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth: 🏗 forkable Ethereum dev stack focused on fast product iterations","url":"https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth"},{"title":"🛠 Interacting with Your Smart Contracts | 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 | Docs","url":"https://scaffold-eth-2-docs.vercel.app/hooks/"},{"title":"Hooks – 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2 | Docs","url":"https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/"},{"title":"scaffold-eth/README.md at master · scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth","url":"https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/blob/master/README.md"},{"title":"Create a DApp with Scaffold-ETH 2 | Moonbeam Docs","url":"https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/ethereum/dev-env/scaffold-eth/"},{"title":"scaffold-eth-docs/deploying-your-contracts.md at master · scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-docs","url":"https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-docs/blob/master/getting-started/deploying-your-contracts.md"},{"title":"GitHub - yuichiroaoki/scaffold-eth-example","url":"https://github.com/yuichiroaoki/scaffold-eth-example"}]},"Here's what I found about configuring scaffold-eth for multiple chain contract deployments:\n\n## Scaffold-ETH Multi-Chain Configuration\n\n### Configuring Networks in Hardhat\n\nScaffold-ETH 2 comes with a selection of predefined networks.

It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\nThe stack of tools for development includes:\n- **NextJS**: A React framework that enables features like server-side rendering for building web applications\n- **RainbowKit**: A React library designed for easily connecting wallets to your dApp\n- **Hardhat**: A development environment for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts\n- **Wagmi**: A collection of React Hooks for Ethereum, simplifying blockchain interactions\n- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language\n- **Viem**: A Typescript library to interface with the blockchain\n\n## Code Organization Patterns\n\n### Project Structure\nThe project is organized into packages:\n- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`\n- Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`\n- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`\n\n### Contract-Frontend Integration\nDeployment metadata is stored in the `/deployments` folder, and automatically copied to `/packages/react-app/src/contracts/hardhat_contracts.json` via the `--export-all` flag in the yarn deploy command.(no content)The custom hooks rely on three main files for their functionality and TypeScript autocompletion: `packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts`, `packages/nextjs/contracts/externalContracts.ts`, and `scaffold.config.ts`. The `deployedContracts.ts` file is auto-generated/updated whenever you run `yarn deploy --network`. It organizes contract addresses and ABIs based on chainId.\n\n### Key Features\nKey features include:\n- **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it\n- **Custom hooks**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around wagmi to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion\n- **Components**: Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend\n\n### Custom Hooks\nScaffold-ETH 2 provides a collection of custom React hooks designed to simplify interactions with your deployed smart contracts. These hooks are wrappers around Wagmi, an easy-to-use interface with typescript autocompletions for reading from, writing to, and monitoring events emitted by your smart contracts.\n\n### Extensions System\nExtensions are modular add-ons for Scaffold-ETH 2 that provide additional functionality or serve as starter-kits for specific features. They offer seamless integration with the base project, enabling quick addition of new features, pages, contracts, or components during initial project setup. They serve as starting points for your project, not finished products, and maintain compatibility with Scaffold-ETH 2 core updates and improvements.\n\n### Configuration\nYou can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ab027577-d6d7-4329-bf5a-35e01b3b2bed","timestamp":"2026-01-07T18:47:21.042Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"scaffold-eth smart contracts frontend code organization patterns","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01KhMjYJLUwQrNxmXyCgQtyr","content":[{"title":"Scaffold-ETH 2","url":"https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/"},{"title":"Introduction to Scaffold-ETH 🏗 | Quicknode Guides","url":"https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/smart-contracts/introduction-to-scaffold-eth"},{"title":"GitHub - scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth: 🏗 forkable Ethereum dev stack focused on fast product iterations","url":"https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth"},{"title":"Scaffold-ETH 2 - Open source toolkit to build dApps on Ethereum","url":"https://scaffoldeth.io/"},{"title":"How to write your first decentralized app — Scaffold-eth Challenge 1: Staking dApp","url":"https://stermi.medium.com/how-to-write-your-first-decentralized-app-scaffold-eth-challenge-1-staking-dapp-b0b6a6f4d242"},{"title":"GitHub - scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-docs: 📑.

Now I have comprehensive research on scaffold-eth. Let me compile a detailed summary of best practices and patterns that could apply to Stellar/Soroban projects.\n\n## Scaffold-ETH Architecture & Best Practices Research Summary\n\nBased on my comprehensive research of the scaffold-eth ecosystem, here's a detailed breakdown of their architecture patterns and best practices:\n\n---\n\n## 1. PROJECT STRUCTURE & CONVENTIONS\n\n### Monorepo Organization\nScaffold-ETH 2 uses a **monorepo structure** with clear separation of concerns:\n\n```\npackages/\n├── hardhat/              # Smart contract development\n│   ├── contracts/        # Solidity contracts\n│   ├── deploy/          # Deployment scripts (00_deploy_*.ts)\n│   └── hardhat.config.ts # Network configuration\n├── nextjs/              # Frontend application\n│   ├── src/\n│   ├── contracts/       # Generated artifacts\n│   └── scaffold.config.ts # Frontend configuration\n└── foundry/            # Optional alternative to Hardhat\n```\n\n### Key Pattern: Configuration-Driven Architecture\n- **Frontend Config** (`scaffold.config.ts`): Single source of truth for network, API keys, and behavior\n- **Contract Artifacts**: Auto-generated and synced between deployment and frontend\n- **Chain-Agnostic Setup**: Network configuration in one place, contracts deployed to multiple chains\n\n---\n\n## 2. SMART CONTRACTS & FRONTEND INTEGRATION\n\n### Artifact Generation & Hot Reload\n- Deployment scripts store metadata in `/deployments` folder\n- Auto-generated TypeScript file at `packages/nextjs/generated/deployedContracts.ts`\n- **Contract Hot Reload**: Frontend automatically adapts to contract changes without manual intervention\n- Uses `--export-all` flag to auto-sync deployment metadata\n\n### Deployment Pattern\n```typescript\n// Deploy script structure (packages/hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.ts)\n// 1. Deploy contract\n// 2. Store metadata\n// 3. Auto-generate TypeScript bindings\n// 4. Frontend picks up ABI and address automatically\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. WALLET CONNECTION & CONTRACT INTERACTION PATTERNS\n\n### Wallet Integration\n- **RainbowKit**: Handles wallet connection with multiple provider support\n- **Burner Wallet**: Built-in lightweight wallet for testing and local development\n- **Auto-Connect**: Burner wallet reconnects on reload if enabled\n\n### Custom React Hooks Pattern (Core Innovation)\nScaffold-ETH wraps wagmi hooks with **TypeScript autocompletion**:\n\n```typescript\n// Three critical files for hook functionality:\n1. deployedContracts.ts      // Auto-generated addresses & ABIs\n2. externalContracts.ts      // External protocol contracts\n3. scaffold.config.ts         // Network configuration\n\n// Usage Pattern:\nconst { data: value } = useScaffoldReadContract({\n  contractName: \"YourContract\",\n  functionName: \"getter\",\n});\n\nconst { writeAsync: setGreeting } = useScaffoldWriteContract({\n  contractName: \"YourContract\",\n  functionName: \"setGreeting\",\n});\n```\n\n### Hook Ecosystem\n- **useScaffoldReadContract**: Read-only state queries\n- **useScaffoldWriteContract**: Write transactions\n- **useScaffoldWatchContractEvent**: Real-time event monitoring\n- **useScaffoldEventHistory**: Historical event logs\n- **useScaffoldContract**: Direct contract instance access\n- **useDeployedContractInfo**: Fetch deployment details\n- **useTransactor**: Transaction handling and feedback\n\n---\n\n## 4. MULTI-CHAIN DEPLOYMENT & CONFIGURATION\n\n### Network Configuration Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// hardhat.config.ts\nnetworks: {\n  localhost: { ... },\n  sepolia: { url: \"...\", accounts: [...] },\n  mainnet: { url: \"...\", accounts: [...] },\n  optimism: { url: \"...\", accounts: [...] },\n  // Add custom networks here\n}\n\n// scaffold.config.ts\ntargetNetworks: [chains.sepolia, chains.optimism, chains.mainnet]\n```\n\n### Deployment to Multiple Chains\n- **Default Network**: Configurable in hardhat.config.ts\n- **Per-Network Deploy**: `yarn deploy --network optimism`\n- **Contract Name Consistency**: Same contract names across chains for proper hook autocompletion\n- **Chain ID Organization**: Contracts organized by chainId in generated artifacts\n\n### Important Multi-Chain Rule\nWhen targeting multiple chains, ensure contract names are consistent across all chains in `targetNetworks[0]`. This is critical for hook functionality and TypeScript autocompletion.\n\n---\n\n## 5. COMPONENT ORGANIZATION PATTERNS\n\n### React Architecture Principles\n- **eth-components Library**: Reusable Ethereum-specific components (Address, Balance, EtherInput, Faucet, etc.)\n- **Pre-built Components**: Common patterns extracted into components to avoid duplication\n- **Wagmi + Viem Integration**: Low-level blockchain interaction wrapped in high-level hooks\n\n### UI Organization\n- **DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS**: Pre-built component styling\n- **Burner Wallet UI**: Default component for wallet selection\n- **Debug Contracts Page**: Interactive contract testing UI\n- **Example Views**: Pre-made YourContract and ExampleUI showcasing two integration approaches\n\n### Caching and Update Patterns\n- **RPC Call Caching**: Prevents unnecessary network requests\n- **Configurable Update Intervals**: Per-block, polling, onMount, onWindowFocus, react-query options\n- **Polling Interval**: Configurable in scaffold.config.ts for data refresh rates\n\n---\n\n## 6. EXTENSION & COMPOSITION SYSTEM\n\n### Extensions Architecture\n- **Modular Add-ons**: Pre-built features integrated seamlessly\n- **Starter Kits**: Extensions for specific protocols (e.g., SablierV2 streaming kit)\n- **Template Components**: Auto-generate new components following scaffold patterns\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Extensions maintain compatibility with core updates\n\n---\n\n## 7. TECHNOLOGY STACK PHILOSOPHY\n\n**The Philosophy**: Scaffold-ETH is NOT a product but a **combination of best-of-breed tools**:\n\n| Layer | Tool(s) | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| Smart Contracts | Hardhat or Foundry | Development, testing, deployment |\n| Frontend | Next.js | React framework with SSR support |\n| Blockchain Interaction | Wagmi + Viem | React hooks + low-level primitives |\n| Wallet Integration | RainbowKit | Multi-wallet support |\n| Contract Binding | TypeChain | TypeScript contract types |\n| Styling | Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI | Utility-first CSS framework |\n| Local Testing | Burner Wallet + Faucet | Quick iteration without real funds |\n\n---\n\n## APPLICATIONS TO STELLAR/SOROBAN PROJECT\n\nBased on scaffold-eth patterns, here's what could be applied to your Stellar/Soroban project:\n\n### 1. **Adopt Monorepo Structure**\n```\npackages/\n├── soroban/\n│   ├── contracts/        # Rust smart contracts\n│   ├── scripts/          # Deployment scripts\n│   └── config.ts         # Network/contract config\n├── frontend/\n│   ├── src/\n│   ├── hooks/            # Custom Soroban interaction hooks\n│   ├── contracts/        # Generated contract artifacts\n│   └── soroban.config.ts # Frontend config (ports, APIs, networks)\n```\n\n### 2. **Create Custom Hooks Layer**\nSimilar to useScaffoldContract pattern, create:\n- `useSorobanContract()`: Get contract instance with auto-completion\n- `useSorobanRead()`: Read contract state with TypeScript bindings\n- `useSorobanWrite()`: Execute contract functions\n- `useSorobanEvents()`: Subscribe to contract events\n- `useSorobanBalance()`: Get Stellar account balances\n\n### 3. **Auto-Generate Contract Bindings**\n- After deployment, auto-generate TypeScript types from contract ABIs\n- Create `deployedContracts.ts` with addresses, ABIs, and network metadata\n- Enable hot-reload of contract artifacts in frontend\n\n### 4. **Multi-Network Configuration Pattern**\n```typescript\n// soroban.config.ts\nexport const sorobanConfig = {\n  targetNetworks: [Network.PUBLIC, Network.TESTNET],\n  contracts: {\n    YourContract: { address: \"...\", abi: ... }\n  },\n  walletConnectProjectId: \"...\",\n  pollingInterval: 5000\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Wallet Integration Strategy**\n- Support multiple Stellar wallets (Freighter, Albedo, Lobstr)\n- Implement burner wallet equivalent for local testing\n- Auto-reconnect on page reload\n- Consistent wallet UI/UX patterns\n\n### 6. **Component Library**\nCreate `soroban-components`:\n- `StellarAddress`: Display formatted Stellar addresses\n- `SorobanBalance`: Show XLM and token balances\n- `SorobanButton`: Execute contract functions\n- `NetworkSelector`: Switch between Stellar networks\n- `SorobanInput`: Input for addresses, amounts, etc.\n\n### 7. **Deployment Pipeline**\n- Deploy scripts that handle Stellar network specifics\n- Store deployment metadata for multi-network support\n- Generate contract bindings automatically\n- Support deploying to Mainnet, Testnet, and local networks\n\n### 8. **Development Workflow**\n- **Local Testing**: Use Soroban local network with test accounts\n- **Testnet Deployment**: Automated deployment with artifact generation\n- **Contract Hot Reload**: Auto-update frontend when contracts change\n- **Debug Tools**: Interactive contract testing interface\n\n### 9. **Configuration Management**\n- Single source of truth (soroban.config.ts)\n- Environment-specific settings\n- Chain-specific contract addresses\n- API key management\n- Network RPC endpoints\n\n### 10. **TypeScript-First Development**\n- Strong typing for contracts and interactions\n- Auto-completion for all contract methods\n- Compile-time error checking\n- Generated types from WASM contract ABIs\n\n---\n\n## KEY BEST PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT\n\n1. **Separation of Concerns**: Smart contracts, deployment, and frontend are separate but tightly integrated\n2. **DRY Principle**: Generate contract bindings automatically instead of manual updates\n3. **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, hooks with autocompletion, pre-built components\n4. **Multi-Chain Ready**: Configuration-driven approach supports multiple networks from day one\n5. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript throughout for compile-time error catching\n6. **Extensibility**: Component library and hook patterns allow easy feature additions\n7. **Testing Support**: Burner wallets and local networks for rapid iteration\n8. **Documentation**: Clear patterns make onboarding faster for new developers\n\n---\n\n## SOURCES\n\n- [Scaffold-ETH 2 Documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/)\n- [Scaffold-ETH 2 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2)\n- [Introduction to Scaffold-ETH -
